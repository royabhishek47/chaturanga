// ðŸ‘‰project introduction : 

Chaturanga is an ancient Indian game believed to be the precursor to modern chess. The game dates back to around the 6th century AD and was played on an 8x8 board, similar to the modern chessboard.

The players should be able to input their moves in the UI. The system should take moves as input from each player alternatively ( player 1 , player 2 , player 1 , player 2 , â€¦ ). 

The board should always be displayed on the screen.

ðŸ‘‰ In each turn the player should have the option to:


        â€¢	  quit ( upon which the other player wins the game ).
        
        â€¢	  Move a piece from its current position to any allowed position based on the rules of the game.

ðŸ‘‰ When a player makes a move:


        â€¢	  The system should check for an illegal move and display appropriate errors and prompt the same user to enter a valid move.
        
        â€¢	  If a player has won, Display the Winner.
        
        â€¢	  The turn changes to the other player.
