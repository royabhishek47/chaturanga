**Introduction about chaturanga:**
Chaturanga is an ancient Indian game believed to be the precursor to modern chess. The game dates back to around the 6th century AD and was played on an 8x8 board, similar to the modern chessboard. 
The name "chaturanga" is derived from a Sanskrit word meaning "four divisions of the military"—infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariots—which are represented by the pieces in the game. 
These pieces evolved into the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively.
